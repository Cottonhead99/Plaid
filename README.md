due to the lack of Api's at the time they settled for a generous 300 million private partnership which 
sparked a wildfire of future partnerships in the same vein.
Plaid's conception materialized into a Financial Tech giant soon to Expand to their origin in the
future. With the assistance of some private investors, the company was on its way to a new destination with a stay just as such without 
revealing much as they are a Private equity company
